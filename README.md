# Obsidian Calendar Events

A lightweight Obsidian plugin that displays events from an **iCal (ICS)** feed directly inside Obsidian.  
Designed for seamless integration with external calendar feeds such as Outlook, Google Calendar, or SharePoint calendar ICS links.

## ✨ Features

- 📅 View upcoming events from any iCal (.ics) feed inside Obsidian  
- 🗓️ Events automatically grouped and sorted by day  
- ⏱️ Configurable date range to control how far ahead events are displayed  
- ⚙️ Simple settings panel for configuration

## 🧩 How It Works

This plugin reads events from a provided iCal (ICS) URL and displays them in a dedicated Obsidian view.  
Events are parsed, grouped by date, and presented in a clean, readable layout inside the app.
